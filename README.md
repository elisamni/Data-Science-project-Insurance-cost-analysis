# Insurance-cost-analysis
Project Description

This project uses a medical insurance dataset to analyze and predict healthcare expenses. Various data processing, visualization, and machine learning methods are applied to create models for predicting charges.

Tasks and Solutions

1. Download the Dataset
Task: Download the dataset from a URL and save it as a CSV file.

2. Import the Dataset
Task: Import the downloaded data into a DataFrame and print the first 10 rows for verification.

3. Data Wrangling
Task: Replace missing values and update data types.

4. Data Visualization
Task: Create a regression plot for charges with respect to BMI.

5. Model Development
Task: Fit a linear regression model to predict charges using the "smoker" attribute.

6. Create a Training Pipeline
Task: Create a pipeline that uses StandardScaler, PolynomialFeatures, and LinearRegression to predict charges using all other attributes.

7. Model Evaluation
Task: Split the data into training and testing subsets and evaluate the model.
